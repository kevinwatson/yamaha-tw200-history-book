During World War II, Yamaha Corp produced fuel tanks, aircraft wings and propellers. After the war, motorcycles became popular modes of transportation in both Europe and Japan. Yamaha saw the demand and started building motorcycles. They established the Yamaha Motor Company, Ltd. to soon after they started to build motorcycles. Their first, the Yamaha YA-1 (aks the Red Dragonfly), was a 4-speed 125 cc engine which had a production run of only 125 units the first year to over 750,000 per year in 1954.

The Red Dragonfly was the first mass-produced motorcycle to feature a primary starting mechanism. Previously, riders were required to put the motorcycle in neutral and pull the clutch lever before kicking the kickstart lever to start the engine. The primary starting mechanism introduced by Yamaha allowed the rider to start the engine whether or not it was in neutral.
