### Chapter 2 - Dual Sport Motorcycles

Dual-sport, enduro, all-road, dual-purpose and other terms describe a motorcycle that is intended for both on and off road use. Dual-sport motorcycles could be considered either a subset of street or off-road bikes.

Dual-sports vary widely depending on the intended use. If they're intended to drive off road more often, they will have knobby tires and a taller seat height with higher ground clearance. If the intention is to ride it more often on paved roads, it may have higher ground clearance and smoother street tires.

To make a bike street legal, it needs to have signal lights, headlight, taillight, speedometer, a horn, mirrors and a license plate. Additional rider comforts for the road might include a wider seat, road tires and raised handlebars.
