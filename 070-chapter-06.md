### Chapter 6 - Summary

Thank you for joining me on this walk through the history and utility of the Yamaha TW200. Along the way, we've gotten a short history lesson of Yamaha, dual-sport bikes, and motorcycles that came before the TW.

The Yamaha TW200, despite its weaknesses, has proven itself with its wide variety of uses. Agricultural, on or off road, on or off trail, or simply an errand vehicle, it has a beloved following and customers who buy a second or third one after wearing the first one out.

Whether you're a TW owner or not, my wish is that you get out there and enjoy the ride!
