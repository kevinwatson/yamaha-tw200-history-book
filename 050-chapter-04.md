### Chapter 4 - The Early Years

On a rainy day in the late 1980s I remember going to a Yamaha dealership with my mom, dad and younger brothers. We were there to buy my dad a motorcycle. I don't remember the specifics on why he picked a TW200. My dad was and still is a negotiator. He negotiated with the salesman for quite a while while my brothers and I sat on and tested every 3 and 4 wheeler on that showroom floor. Near the end of those negotiations, my dad had worked the salesman over. It came time to take our purchase and go home, but we had driven the 50 miles to the dearlership in a car, and had no way to load it up. My dad, ever the negotiator, talked the salesman into throwing in a helmet (and rear rack) for free so the motorcycle could be ridden home. I remember mom getting behind the wheel of the car and following dad all of the way home in the rainstorm.

That day was the day I started my TW journey. We owned and operated a sheep and cattle farm in Sanpete county, Utah. We owned a number of motorcycles, but the TW was always the machine of choice for running to an alfalfa or barley field to move sprinklers or when we were mending fences. It's great gas mileage and ability to legally drive on pavement but then cross over to driving along a fence line made it our universal choice of transportation.

Because we raised sheep, we always had a working dog or two when I was growing up. We had a number of grazing properties that were separate from each other where we would run small herds of cattle and sheep. When checking on these small herds, we would usually need a dog with us if some of the animals had found a hole in the fence and gotten out. Prefering to ride the TW to check the fences created a dilemma: how do you take both the TW and the dog?

My dad came up with the perfect solution: train the dog to ride on the motorcycle. We had a few neighbors who had trained their dogs to ride on the front, but that can create an issue where the dog is blocking your view of the road. My dad decided that the utility rack on the back was the best place for the dog - if the dog wanted to jump off, it was free to do so and it wouldn't interfere with his driving at any time. The dog we had at the time was a red and blue heeler mix that we named Ringo. The first couple of times the dog didn't do so well on the back, but soon it realized that if it wanted to run down to the field with my dad, then it needed to learn how to stay on or it would have to run the entire way. After a few months of falling off, the dog could stay on under nearly any circumstance. I remember a few times where my dad was driving, one of my younger brothers was in front of him on the gas tank (the TW's seat extends over part of the gas tank), I was behind my dad with my feet on the passenger foot pegs, and Ringo was sitting on the rack above the back tire. Ringo found that he was more stable when a passenger was onboard and he could lean against them which made the whole thing a multi-layered sandwich. On one particular day with 4 of us on the back of the TW, were riding through some brush and ran over a large ant pile or sagebrush (I forget what the obstacle was). The three of us in front nearly spilled off the bike, but the dog had enough stability to stay on.

My dad's sister grew up and moved north. She had a friend that visited the small town where we lived and then they were later talking about her visit. She told her that she enjoyed the historical buildings on main street, but pointed out that there was something that caught her attention as she was leaving town - she saw a red dog riding on the back of a motorcycle. My aunt laughed and told her that was her brother and that he was probably heading to the field to check on the crops. Of all of the things to see in our town, that was the one thing that her friend remembered the most.
