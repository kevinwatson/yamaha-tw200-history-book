### Chapter 3 - Yamaha Introduces the TrailWay 200

The year was 1987. It marked a number of introductions. The Simpsons was first introduced on The Tracey Ullman Show. On October 19, a stock market crash named Black Monday occurred. The first Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant opened in China. The Nike Air Max (unique in that it has an air compartment in the sole) and the first version of Photoshop are also introduced.

1987 was also the year that Yamaha introduced the TW200, also known as the Trailway (the Trailway name was dropped at the time the 2001 model was released). The TW200 was first introduced in Japan and North America. It was later introduced in Europe.

Because the TW200 fits in the dual-sport category, it can be compared to other dual-sport bikes, dirt bikes, and road bikes. When compared to the competition, the TW200 fails in a number of ways. It's low gear ratio hurts its rankings for road use, it's small engine and low ground clearance hurts its rankings for off road and dual-sport use, but it finds its niche for riders who want to do more off roading than on road but don't mind that it takes a little longer to get there.

In 2002 the Suzuki RV200 VanVan was released in North America. It has looks similar to the TW200 with a smaller diameter but wider tire in the back. Stock tires on the RV200 are street, not knobby like the TW200. Its engine is similar in size and it's also street legal.
