## Chapter 5 - Evolution

One of the unique things about the TW is how little it has changed since its introduction. The same square headlight, tires and engine have been sold on the TW with little to no variation. The one thing that has changed each year is the color scheme. The largest change was in 2001 when the kickstarter was removed. The same year the front drum brake was replaced with a disc brake. The carburetor was also modified.

## Kickstarter

To the surprise of many, the kickstarter was removed from the 2001 model of the TW. Yamaha made it optional with a separate kit that was available through their dealerships.

## Front Brake

Also with the 2001 model, the front brake was switched from a drum brake to a disc brake.

## Carburetor
