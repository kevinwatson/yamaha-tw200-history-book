## Chapter 5 - Evolution

One of the unique things about the TW is how little it has changed since its introduction. The same square headlight, tires and engine have been features of the TW with little to no variation. The one thing that has changed almost each year is the color scheme. Two of the most drastic changes were in 2001 when the kickstarter was removed and front drum brake was replaced with a disc brake.

## Dimensions

The dimensions of the TW frame changed slightly starting with the 2001 model.
