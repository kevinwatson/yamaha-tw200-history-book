## Chapter 5 - Evolution

One of the unique things about the TW is how little it has changed since its introduction. The same square headlight, tires and engine have been sold on the TW with little to no variation. The one thing that has changed almost each year is the color scheme. The largest change was in 2001 when the kickstarter was removed. The same year the front drum brake was replaced with a disc brake. The carburetor was also modified.

## Dimensions

The dimensions of the TW frame also changed slightly starting with the 2001 model.
